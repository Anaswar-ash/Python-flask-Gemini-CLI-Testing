## System Architecture

The application is a monolithic service based on the Flask web framework. It consists of two main components:

1.  **`app.py`**: The main application file that contains the Flask web server and defines the API endpoints.
2.  **`database.py`**: This module acts as a data access layer. It contains the mock database (a Python list of dictionaries) and the business logic for retrieving and sorting the data.

## Data Model

The application uses a simple, in-memory data structure to represent the database. Each item in the database is a dictionary with the following fields:

-   `id` (integer): A unique identifier for the item.
-   `name` (string): The name associated with the item.

Example:
```json
{
  "id": 1,
  "name": "Alice"
}
```

## API Endpoints

            },

            },
            {
